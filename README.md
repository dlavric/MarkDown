import time
import random
 
print('Welcome to Self Timer')

print('Everybody stand up')
print('Stay standing until you think the time has ended')
print('Then sit down.')
print('Anyone still standing when the time ends loses.')
print('The last person to sit down before the time ended will win.')

# get a random stand time and store it
stand_time = random.randint(5, 20) 

print('Stay standing for', stand_time, 'seconds.')

# sleep for stand time
time.sleep(stand_time) 

print('****TIME UP****')
